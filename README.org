#+TITLE: Emacs Utilities and Packages

This repository contains a variety of emacs utilities
and packages that I have written (and that I use regularly).
For my original emacs modes and initialization file
see the repositories ~emacs-modes~ and ~emacs-init~.

The current contents are as follows:

  + =win-switch=

    Defines a command ~win-switch-dispatch~ to be used in
    place of =other-window= that engages a dynamic,
    transient keyboard override, allowing one to efficiently
    move among defined windows (and frames) -- and even
    resize, split, delete them -- with minimal fuss and
    effort. When the override is engaged, the movement and
    resizing commands are bound to simple keys that can be
    pressed quickly with one hand. The override ends either
    when the user exits explicitly or after a configurable
    idle time threshold. The happy outcome is fast and
    seamless navigation.
