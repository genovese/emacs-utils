<h2 id="sec-1"><span class="section-number-2">1</span> Introduction </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">


<p>
One wonderful efficiency feature in Emacs is the ability to
divide the current view into disjoint rectangular panels
(called windows in Emacs terminology) that can be seen and
manipulated simultaneously.<sup><a class="footref" name="fnr.1" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup> Taken together, Emacs
windows and buffers provide a much more versatile and
efficient interface than tabbed browsing or similar designs.
</p>
<p>
It is not uncommon for people to keep up to 6 windows in a
frame. But when you use multiple windows in this way, you
may frequently find yourself moving among the windows using
`other-window' (C-x o) again and again &ndash; an unpleasantly
large number of keystrokes for so common a maneuver. And
because the order of windows in the window list need not
relate intuitively to windows' visual positions, moving more
efficiently requires context-specific prefix arguments along
the way. The tiring outcome is that navigation through a
complex window configuration demands many keystrokes and/or
nontrivial attention. This package is designed to solve that
problem.
</p>
<p>
While the <code>windmove</code> package provides functions for moving
intuitively among windows, the natural key bindings for these
functions (e.g., the arrow keys with some modifier) require a
distant and thus inefficient hand movement. Moreover, one often
wants to mix a variety of window-based operations (other-window,
previous-window, directional movement, resizing) in rapid
succession, which windmove does not easily support.
</p>
<p>
This package builds on the windmove functionality by defining a
command <code>win-switch-dispatch</code> that engages a dynamic, transient
keyboard override, allowing one to efficiently move among defined
windows (and frames) &ndash; and even resize, split, delete them &ndash; with
minimal fuss and effort. When the override is engaged, the movement
and resizing commands are bound to simple keys that can be pressed
quickly with one hand. The override ends either when the user exits
explicitly or after a configurable idle time threshold. The happy
outcome is fast and seamless navigation.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> Installation </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">


<p>
To use the package, download <code>win-switch.el</code> and place it
somewhere in your load path.<sup><a class="footref" name="fnr.2" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup> Then, execute the following code
either directly or from in your .emacs file:
</p>



<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(<span style="color: #7f007f;">require</span> '<span style="color: #008b8b;">win-switch</span>)
(global-set-key <span style="color: #8b2252;">"\C-xo"</span> 'win-switch-dispatch)
</pre>



<p>
or use whatever keybinding you ordinarily have set to <code>other-window</code>.
Alternatively, you can use one of a variety of predefined configuration
commands, as in
</p>



<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(<span style="color: #7f007f;">require</span> '<span style="color: #008b8b;">win-switch</span>)
(win-switch-setup-keys-ijkl <span style="color: #8b2252;">"\C-xo"</span>)
</pre>



<p>
which has the same effect as the above. In fact, the latter approach
is preferred somewhat as it makes it easier to explore other configurations
or bindings. See <a href="#config">Configuring win-switch</a> below.
</p>
<p>
At this point, when you execute a window switch (i.e., hit <code>C-x o</code>),
Emacs will (typically) enter window switching mode allowing you to navigate
among the windows (and frames). This is described in more detail in
the next section.
</p>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3"><span class="section-number-2">3</span> Using win-switch </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">


<p>
When executing the <code>win-switch-dispatch</code> command, Emacs's
behavior depends on the win-switch parameter settings and
the current window configuration. Under the default
settings, when there are three or more windows, Emacs will
enter window switching mode. This temporarily overrides all
key bindings, with selected keys moving among the windows
(or frames) and resizing, splitting, or deleting the current
window. Window switching lasts until either the user exits
explicitly (in one of two ways) or idle time exceeds the
threshold in the variable <code>win-switch-idle-time</code>. Whenever
possible, visual feedback is provided to indicate the window
switching state. The following keys are bound by default
during window switching mode:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Directional Navigation
<ul>
<li>
i select the window above the current window.
</li>
<li>
k select the window below the current window.
</li>
<li>
j select the window left of the current window.
</li>
<li>
l select the window right of the current window.

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Cycling Navigation
<ul>
<li>
o cycles forward through the window list in the current frame.
</li>
<li>
p cycles backward through the window list in the current frame.
</li>
<li>
SPACE cycles among existing frames.

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Exiting
<ul>
<li>
u (and RETURN) exit window switching mode.
</li>
<li>
Any key not bound to a win-switch command exits
window switching mode (like u does) and then executes
the original function.
</li>
<li>
Waiting idle for more than <code>win-switch-idle-time</code> will
exit window switching mode (like u does)
</li>
<li>
C-M-g is an "emergency" exit<sup><a class="footref" name="fnr.3" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Resizing
<ul>
<li>
I vertically enlarges the current window
</li>
<li>
K vertically shrinks the current window
</li>
<li>
L horizontally enlarges the current window
</li>
<li>
J horizontally shrinks the current window

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Splitting and Deleting Windows
<ul>
<li>
h splits the current window into two equal windows,
one above the other.  (H is a visual mnemonic for the split.)
</li>
<li>
; splits the current window into two equal windows,
side by side. (: is a visual mnemnoic for the split.)
</li>
<li>
0 deletes the current window  
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>


<p>
These keys are chosen to make one-handed navigation fast and easy.
It is worth re-emphasizing that any key not bound to a win-switch
command exits window switching mode and executes its original function.
This is the most common way to exit window switching mode: just do what
you want to do in the current window and it will be done.
An explicit exit is only required when the first key in the
current window is one of the win-switch commands, which should be
relatively rare.
</p>
<p>
By default, window selection wraps around when moving across a frame
edge and window switching mode is forgone when there are only two
windows. But these features, the key bindings, and other parameters
can all be customized, either with the customization facility or
with defvar and setter functions, as described in the next section.

<p>The default keybindings are designed for fast and intuitve,
one-handed operation, but if desired the key bindings can be

The command keys also can be rebound in groups via the
variables with names <code>win-switch-&lt;name&gt;-keys</code> where <code>&lt;name&gt;</code>
can be one of up, down, left, right, next-window,
previous-window, enlarge-vertically, shrink-vertically,
enlarge-horizontally, shrink-horizontally, other-frame,
exit, split-vertically, split-horizontally, delete-window,

<h4 id="sec-4_1_3"><span class="section-number-4">4.1.3</span> Key-setting API </h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4_1_3">


<p>
Several functions are available for adjusting the key lists
associated with a particular win-switch command. These are
<code>win-switch-add-key</code>, <code>win-switch-delete-key</code>, and
<code>win-switch-set-keys</code>, which as the names suggest add and
delete a key and set the key list, respectively. These
functions take a key (or key-list in the latter case) and a
command symbol, where the command symbol is one of up, down,
left, right, next-window, previous-window,
enlarge-vertically, shrink-vertically, enlarge-horizontally,
shrink-horizontally, other-frame, exit, split-vertically,
split-horizontally, delete-window, or emergency-exit. They
are used as follows:
</p>



<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(win-switch-add-key    <span style="color: #8b2252;">"O"</span> 'previous-window)
(win-switch-delete-key <span style="color: #8b2252;">"p"</span> 'previous-window)
(win-switch-set-keys   '(<span style="color: #8b2252;">" "</span> <span style="color: #8b2252;">","</span> <span style="color: #8b2252;">"m"</span>) 'other-frame)
</pre>



<p>
Note that the last arguments here are win-switch commands
not elisp functions. At least one exit key must always be
defined.
</p>
<p>
The function <code>win-switch-define-key</code> is also available for
setting general commands in the win-switch keymap, but the
other key setting functions and methods are certainly
preferred when applicable.
</p>
<p>
If key bindings are not set by the customize mechanism,
they can be set in in the hook <code>win-switch-load-hook</code> before
loading the package.

<h4 id="sec-4_1_4"><span class="section-number-4">4.1.4</span> Once-Keys </h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4_1_4">


<p>
The "command" <code>win-switch-dispatch-once</code> is a prefix command/keymap
that can be used in place of the standard <code>win-switch-dispatch</code>
command. This accepts a single win-switch command, by default
using the same keybindings as standard win-switch (excluding
the exit keys), and gives one switch. There are two additional
groups of keys <code>double-next-window</code> and <code>double-previous-window</code>
which cycle forward and backward two windows in the list.
While not as flexible as window switching mode, the once-dispatch
allows easy maneuvering in up to five windows with a single
key stroke. The once command keys can be set with either
the customize mechanism or the <code>win-switch-set-once-key</code> function.
</p>
</div>

<h4 id="sec-4_1_5"><span class="section-number-4">4.1.5</span> win-switch-dispatch-with </h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4_1_5">


<p>
The macro <code>win-switch-dispatch-with</code> accepts an elisp command
and produces a new command that first executes the given
command and then <code>win-switch-dispatch</code>. It can be used
to create dispatch commands with customized initial behavior.
See <code>win-switch-setup-keys-arrows</code> for an example.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4_2">


<p>
Besides key bindings, the most important customization options are
the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>win-switch-idle-time</code>

<p>
Window switching mode exits automatically after Emacs is
idle for more than this time. The idle time should be
set so that one does not have to either rush or wait.
(While explicit exit always works, it is nice to have
window-switching mode end on its own at just the right
time.) This may require some personalized fiddling to
find a comfortable value, though the default should be
pretty good.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<code>win-switch-window-threshold</code>

<p>
When the current frame has more than this many windows,
<code>win-switch-dispatch</code> enters window-switching mode
unconditionally; otherwise, it acts like
<code>win-switch-other-window-function</code> (which is
<code>other-window</code> by default).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<code>win-switch-other-window-first</code>

<p>
Whether to move to next window in the window list before
entering window switching mode. This can be either a
boolean value or a function that returns a boolean
function. The latter allows a context sensitive
decision; see <code>win-switch-authors-configuration</code> for an
example.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<code>win-switch-wrap-around</code>  (set via <code>win-switch-set-wrap-around</code>.)

<p>
If non-nil, directional moves across the edge of the
frame wrap around to the other side of the frame
(top to bottom, left to right, etc.). This should
not be set directly but by the setting function
<code>win-switch-set-wrap-around</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<code>win-switch-other-window-function</code>

<p>
If non-nil, this should be a function that handles the
window switching as does <code>other-window</code>. One application
of this parameter is when win-switch is used with
packages like icicles that remap the other-window
function (see <code>icicle-other-window-or-frame</code>). If nil,
the default, <code>other-window</code> is used.
</p></li>
</ul>


<p>
The other customizable parameters control how win-switch
mode gives feedback indicating whether window switching is
engaged.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>win-switch-provide-visual-feedback</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>win-switch-feedback-background-color</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>win-switch-feedback-foreground-color</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>win-switch-on-feedback-function</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>win-switch-off-feedback-function</code>
</li>
</ul>


<p>
The feedback mechanisms are intended to make it salient when
window switching mode is on or off and can be customized at
several scales. The default method changes the
colors on the mode line in the current window during
window switching mode (restoring them after), along
with transient messages in the echo area.
</p>
<p>
Finally, three hooks are available to change settings or
behavior at load time, when window switching turns on, and
when window switching turns off. Extra care should be taken
to handle errors properly in the latter two, if they are
used.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>win-switch-load-hook</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>win-switch-on-hook</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>win-switch-off-hook</code>
</li>
</ul>

(There are other ways to run tests in the framework but
that is the simplest.)
A report on the test results will then come up, typically
in its own frame. If there are any failures, instructions

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6">


<p>
win-switch is not a formal major or minor mode, more of an
overriding mode. This started as a way to explore dynamic
keybindings, an idea that is generalized considerably in my
packages <code>quick-nav</code> and <code>power-keys</code>. The latter introduces
some programming abstractions that can be used to easily
install dynamic keymaps of several flavors. I plan to use
the <code>power-keys.el</code> mechanisms for this package in a later
version.

<div id="text-footnotes">
<p class="footnote"><sup><a class="footnum" name="fn.1" href="#fnr.1">1</a></sup> There is an unfortunate conflict in terminology between Emacs
and traditional window systems. An Emacs <i>frame</i> corresponds to a
<i>window</i> in a traditional window system. An Emacs <i>window</i> is a
panel within a frame that displays a <i>buffer</i>. There is no direct
analog to windows and buffers in standard window systems, though
tabbed browsing is perhaps the closest common approach.
I will use Emacs terminology in what follows.
</p>
<p class="footnote"><sup><a class="footnum" name="fn.2" href="#fnr.2">2</a></sup> Common locations are the system site-lisp directory or
the sub-directory <code>.emacs.d</code> of the user's home directory.
Alternatively, you can load the file directly with the
<code>load-file</code> command.
</p>
<p class="footnote"><sup><a class="footnum" name="fn.3" href="#fnr.3">3</a></sup> The emergency exit key causes a no-frills escape from
window switching mode in case of an unexpected error during
a user defined function or hook (as a customization option)
called during window switching mode. This is a paranoid
precaution only, and you are very unlikely to need this. Use
only as a last resort because it does not handle feedback or
other clean up mechanisms. This functionality may be removed
in future versions.
